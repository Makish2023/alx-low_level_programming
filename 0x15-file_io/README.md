File I/O stands for File Input/Output. It is a way to read and write data to files on a computer system. It is used to store and retrieve data from files, such as text, images, audio, and video. File I/O is an essential part of any programming language and is used in almost all programs.


File I/O involves a few different operations to read and write data to files. These operations include opening a file, reading from the file, writing to the file, closing the file, and finally deleting the file. Each of these operations is necessary for file I/O to work properly.


When you open a file, you have to specify the file path and mode. The mode can be read, write, append, or update. After you open the file, you can then read data from it or write data to it. When you are finished, you can close the file. This will ensure that all the changes you made to it are saved.


Finally, you can delete the file if you want to. This will remove the file from the computer system.
